# Blaauw Dashboard
This was my thesis for my astronomy bachelor. I created an interactive dashboard to allow easier access to all observation data from the Kapteyn Institute.
With this dashboard, users can search through all data by date, date range, object or coordinates and immediately inspect the returned entries.
The dashboard interacts with the database of the Blaauw Observatory Archive, which is where all observation data is stored.
It generates queries based on the user input and then presents the information to the user in tabular form.
From this table, users can see all kinds of information about each entry, such as filter, coordinates and observation date.
These entries can be selected and then viewed, which allows for a quick and easy inspection of the observation data.
I used local data, because I haven't yet been able to allow for remote access to the archive.
